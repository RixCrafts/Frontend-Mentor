## My process

- Gather all the necessary resources like, texts, fonts, pictures, color, sizes

- Base on the layout select a proper wokflow that allows me to work fast and easy.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

The filter CSS property applies graphical effects like blur or color shift to an element. Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of images, backgrounds, and borders.


```css
.image__container>img {
    filter: sepia(90%) brightness(75%) saturate(550%) hue-rotate(230deg);
}
```

### Continued development

Continue working with the filter property and all it method and find an easy way to search for the necessary values on eah method.
