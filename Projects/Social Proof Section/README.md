## My process

Divide the page in two section to use flex (I consider the usage of grid here a little more complicated than using flex). Develop for desktop first and use media queries for responsiveness.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Use pseudo-element can help with the design as well 

### Continued development

Keep building Frontend Mentor projects to optimize my workflow
